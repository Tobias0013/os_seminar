(personal notes)
solved using synchronized and wait/notify in Data class.

Added synchronized to read and write func in Data class
This ensures that only one process can access the Data class at a time.

does not keep track of how many readers reading
does not keep track if writer is writing

Problems:
does not appear that i have the same problems as in sol1
no apparent starvation of writers
(but I suspect it can happen because nothing prevents it from happening)
