Mutual Exclusion (or Exclusive Control):
At least one resource must be non-shareable, meaning that only one process or thread can access it at a time.
This condition ensures that once a process acquires a resource, it has exclusive control over that resource.

Hold and Wait: (id did)
Processes must hold at least one resource and must be waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently
held by other processes. In other words, a process that is already holding some resources can request additional
resources while still holding its existing ones.

No Preemption:
Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a process. Resources can only be released voluntarily by the process that holds them.
 This condition ensures that a process cannot be interrupted and have its resources taken away, which could lead to inconsistency.

Circular Wait:
There must exist a circular chain of two or more processes, where each process is waiting for a resource held by the next process in the chain.
This circular chain creates a cycle of dependencies that prevents any process in the cycle from proceeding.
