# Info for whoever checks the code

I have divided my code into packages for the different tasks and sub-tasks in this seminar.

## Here is info about them:

### Task 1

- solution -> This is the one that solves the reader-writer problem according to the specification in the task. 
(Reader gets priority)
- alt1 -> This is primarily for me (having fun). This solves the reader-writer problem but not according to the 
specifications. (No reader or writer priority)
- orig -> This is the original files. (from Seminar2.zip)

### Task 2

- solution -> This is the one that solves the first part of task 2 according to the specifications. (solved problem with starving writers)
- reentrantReadWriteLock -> This is the one that uses the built-in java library to solve reader-writer problem.

### Task 3

- deadlockSolution -> This is the one that solves so that a philosopher waits if a chopstick is already used by another philosopher. (could deadlock)
- solution -> This is the one that solves so that there can not be any deadlocks.
- orig -> This is the original files. (from Seminar2.zip)
