(personal notes)
solved by adding writer_que in RWLock
writer_que:
increment when writer is waiting
decrement when writer is finished

by making a reader wait if there is a reader in que then the reader gets priority


Problem:
(apparently) reader starving (I only noticed that it happen rarely. But I can se that it might happen)
why writer priority:
* All reader are supposed to wait if there are any writer in que.
